# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
### Purpose
    The Purpose of the challenge is to show the many different ways to represent data sets. Sometimes, there 
    are alot of information, and in order to see the trends and correlation between data sets, it would be 
    ideal to represent it in a model. In addition, with Pyber Analysis, it can be helpful for businesses to 
    be able to parse the dataframe into a chat/graph in order to look at trends to see where to focus on in 
    regards to business spending or priotitization, like having more drives set out to urban areas, or encouraging
    increasing prices based on demand. For graphs it is imperative that businesses are able to view the data based 
    off of dates, and graphing with Matplotlib will help with that as well.

### Results
    Based off of the data sets and data frames, there is a clear distinction between the number of drivers, the demand
    for ride share, as well as the aggregate fares, and averages. For starters there is a clear trend in different datasets
    between the different city types in regards to the total fares, the total drivers, as well as the number of rides in different
    areas. In the urban area, there are the most people using rideshares with 1625 rides, and there are 2405 drivers. the average
    ride fare is $24.5 and drivers charge an average of $16.6. For the suburban area there are significantly less rides with only
    625 rides, 490 drivers, $19,356.3 in fares. The average ride fare is around $31 and drivers charge on average, $39.5. Finally
    in rural areas there are only 125 rides, 78 drivers, the fares total up around $4,327. For the averages it is $34.6 in ride fares
    and the average driver fares is $55.5. The conclusions we can make based on the results are that in urban areas, because it is 
    generally more busy in the area there are a higher demand in rides and there are more activity in drivers as well. Prices there
    are the cheapest, considering how many drivers there are and how easy it is to get a ride share. In suburban areas there is less
    activity in those areas, so the price is cheaper as people are most likely using rideshare to go from their homes to other homes, or
    to urban cities. It is generally more quiet in activiy, so the average fares are generally higher, taking into the people that uses ride share
    and the rates the drivers are charging in these suburban areas. The area with the less activity, the rural area has less people and drivers
    because demand in rural areas is the lowest, considering many factors such as how rural areas tend to not be busy, and the population tends to be 
    lower. Because of this, there are less people taking rideshare, and that is why the averages are generally higher, and the driver fares are the most
    expensive, considering how rare it is to get people to use rideshare in these areas, which is why the total fares are the lowest compared to the 
    urban and rural areas.

    From the line chart, we can see that the fares data fluctuates between the three city types in different months. Overall, Urban areas
    earn the most money, with suburban areas in the middle in profits, and rural areas generating less in fares. The common trends between
    the data sets is that in the later half of February there is a generally peek in fares. One thing to consider, however is how often 
    urban areas change in fares. Urban areas tend to have the most peeks and dives from mid February to April. In rural areas, there seems 
    to be a noticable fluctuation in the first months and the peeks are generally torward the end of the month, with a drop right at the beginning
    of the month. Suburban areas seem to have the fewest peeks and fluctuations, being mostly consistent, at least compared to the urban and rural data
    sets.

### Pyber Summary
    Based off of the results and trends, there are three recomendations that will possibly address the fluctuations or maybe
    earn more in regards to profit, and advancing the company further.
    
    * Because Urban Areas have the most people in the area as they need to get to work, school, or maybe hang out in the different
      places in these cities, there are a few ways to boost revenue and maybe have more people use the services. Maybe increasing the prices
      a bit will generate more revenue in fares, as ride shares in busy urban areas is essential for transportation. Maybe even have different deals
      and offers like a discount for people that often uses these rideshares as there are going to be people that use these services alot.
     
    * In suburban areas, there are suggestions that are simialiar to urban areas. One important goal is to increase incentive in suburban areas,
      and just like urban areas, there can be different deals and offers for riders to participate more in ridesharing services. Moreover, there can
      be different classes in rideshare such as deluxe, or regular depending on what the rides are and why the rider is using the services.
      
    * In rural areas, there are many different improvements that can be made. For starters, maybe trying to hire or encourage more drivers to be in the area
      to lower the prices for people to use the services, as a major factor in the high prices in urban areas is the lack of drivers in the area, as well as the
      riders there. So, by including some more drivers in the area, as well as promoting ride share and its benefits to the people in rural areas may better the 
      total fares in the area
