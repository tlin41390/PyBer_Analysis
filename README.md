# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
### Purpose
  The Purpose of the challenge is to show the many different ways to represent data sets. Sometimes, there 
  are alot of information, and in order to see the trends and correlation between data sets, it would be 
  ideal to represent it in a model. In addition, with Pyber Analysis, it can be helpful for businesses to 
  be able to parse the dataframe into a chat/graph in order to look at trends to see where to focus on in 
  regards to business spending or priotitization, like having more drives set out to urban areas, or encouraging
  increasing prices based on demand. For graphs it is imperative that businesses are able to view the data based 
  off of dates, and graphing with Matplotlib will help with that as well.

### Results
  Based off of the data sets and data frames, there is a clear distinction between the number of drivers, the demand
  for ride share, as well as the aggregate fares, and averages. For starters there is a clear trend

### School District Summary
    * Overall, The Four Major Changes in the school district analysis, after updating the ninth grade scores, 
    is that the average math score for Charter schools, increased, as well as the average reading scores increased as well. 
    In additon the overall passing rate has increased because THS is a charter school. As for the  size of the school, the averages 
    for a school size around THS will increase when the overall results of THS scores increase as well. Moreover, if we are to look at
    the school data based on budget per person, because THS falls in the range of 630-644($638) the scores for that range will increase as well.
